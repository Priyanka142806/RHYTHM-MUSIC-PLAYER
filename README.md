A GUI based music player built using python and its libraries.

#ABOUT
Everybody loves listening to  music and creating your very own mp3 music player would be even more exciting. So, here I have created an mp3 player with the help of python and its libraries in which we can play the song, pause it, resume it, rewind it and navigate between the songs in our local system.
